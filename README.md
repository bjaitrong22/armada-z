# `Application Name`

Armada-Z

## `Brief Description`
Spaceship shooting game with one player ship and two enemy ships. The game is playable, but is not complete.

Keys for controlling the player ship:

1. 'ArrowUp' to move the ship in the negative y direction, towards the top of your screen.
2. 'ArrowDown' to move the ship in the positive y direction, towards the bottom of your screen.
3. 'ArrowLeft' to move the ship in the negative x direction, left side of your screen.
4. 'ArrowRight to move the ship in the positive x direction, the right side of your screen.
5. 'ArrowUp' and {'ArrowLeft' or 'ArrowRight'} combination, will move the ship up and towards the left or up and towards the right respectively.
6. 'ArrowDown' and {'ArrowLeft' or 'ArrowRight'} combination, will move down and towards the left or down and towards the right respectively.
7. Space bar is for shooting the ship's weapon(front).
8. 'd' currently is being used to show the hit boxes for all ships. I may modify the code and use it to turn on a shield.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

  1. Clone the repository to your desktop or a subdirectory in your desktop and using this link **https://github.com/bjaitrong22/armada-z.git**

    * Be careful not to clone the repository inside a local repository. Otherwise, you will have a    nested git respository.

  2. Navigate to the top level/root of the armada-z directory using your command line. 
  3. Open the project using your text editor of your choosing.
  4. To start a development server and view the project in your browser:

     * Navigate to the top level/root of the armada-z directory using your command line.
     * Run the command "npm install" to install the dependencies.
     * Run the command "npm run build" to bundle the files.
     * To start a development server, run the command "npm run start".

## Known Bugs
  * If you change the Arrow key press from one key to another Arrow key, you may see a trail of particles from the ship. It may be a machine performance issue, but I am not sure. 
  * chrome limits the number of media player per page so you may get the following message:
  <mark>"Blocked attempt to create a WebMediaPlayer as there are too many WebMediaPlayers already in existence"<mark>.
  * The other known issue is the "Uncaught(in promise) DOMException:play() failed because the user didn't interac witht the document first.
